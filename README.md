## Introduction

DRMAA for Torque/PBS Pro is an implementation of Open Grid Forum  DRMAA (Distributed Resource Management Application API) specification for submission and control jobs to PBS systems:  Torque and  PBS Professional. Using DRMAA, grid applications builders, portal developers and ISVs can use the same high-level API to link their software with different cluster/resource management systems.
